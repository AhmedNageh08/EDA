## Data

You can download data from here : https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017 <br/>

Stack Overflow conducts a massive survey of people on the site, covering all sorts of information like programming languages, salary, code style and various other information.They amassed more than 64,000 responses fielded from 213 countries.

## Motivation

I try to build a model to predict the salary(target) depending on many features and find relations between different features and how they can affect each other.


## Analysis

 I have many questions about the data and i tried to answer some of them in my code file like : <br/>
 *Are all developers studied computer science before? <br/>
 *What's top 5 famous programing language in every count? <br/>
 *What about the job satisfaction in every developer field? <br/>
 *How developers think about learning new things? <br/>
